Convert a number to the spelled out word!

## About

I saw a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/8154jy/c_print_out_the_words_for_any_given_integer/)
that inspired me to write this. I was also very bored and wanted to see how easily I could make a number
to english converter. The rule was that no arrays other than the C string were allowed to be used.
Turns out, that's probably the best approach to take anyways. Hope you learn from this!
